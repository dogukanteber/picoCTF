Let's first download the java file and look what is inside. 

It is 26 lines of java code. Probably the password is inside the source code. In the main function, on the 5th line we are creating a new instance of our class. Then, we are taking an input from the user on lines 6-8. 

After that, we are extracting from 8th character to the previous last character which is the core part of our flag. 

The program then calls checkPassword function and if the comparions is successfull it means we got the correct password. checkPassword function does simple comparison. If the extracted input is equal to "w4rm1ng_Up_w1tH_jAv4_eec0716b713". 

We are extracted the core part of our flag. Now, it is time to put them together and get the flag which is ```picoCTF{w4rm1ng_Up_w1tH_jAv4_eec0716b713}```
