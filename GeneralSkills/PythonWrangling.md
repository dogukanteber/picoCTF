We are given a python script that takes one flag and a file as parameters. We need to provide a flag(-d or -e) and an encrypted file. It looks like this:

```python3 ende.py -d flag.txt.en```

After running this script we are asked to enter a password. Terminate the program by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>. Copy the content of pw.txt and run the above command again. This time enter the copied content of pw.txt and paste it to the terminal. It will give us the flag.
