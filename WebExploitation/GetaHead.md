There is nothing much on the website. It will show blue and red background. When we inspecting the http requests with Burp, we cannot see much except HTTP methods. The challange title gives us a clue about which HTTP request we need.

So, when we open Burp and click "Choose Red" the request is GET. When we click "Choose Blue" the request is POST. Let's again click the "Choose Red" button and send the request to Repeater. Then, change the HTTP request to HEAD and Send it. Voila! The flag is revealed: picoCTF{r3j3ct_th3_du4l1ty_2e5ba39f}
