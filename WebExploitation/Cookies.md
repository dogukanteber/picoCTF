Let's enter snickerdoodle for the input. We see "I love snickerdoodle cookies!" message. Open up developer tools by pressing F12 and go to storage tab(Firefox). Modify the value of the cookie named name. Change its value to 1 and reload the site(F5). We see "I love chocolate chip cookies!" message. The flag is assigned one of the other values. We can either try every possible way by hand or we can write a script that does this job for us.

For the first option, you must try every number from 1 to n until you find the flag.

For the second option, we must write a bash script. You can write it with Python as well. The script looks like this:

#!/bin/bash

for i in {0..28}
	do
		curl --cookie "name=$i" "http://mercury.picoctf.net:6418/check"
done

The reason why we go until 0 to 28 is 28 is the upper bound. You can try different numbers to get 28. Make the script executable by entering this:

chmod +x script.sh

And since the output is too crowded to pick the flag, we use grep command the get the flag.

./script.sh | grep "pico" will give us the flag.
