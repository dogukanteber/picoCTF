The website seems very basic. Let's look at it source code. 

Click right and click view source code. Looking at the source code, we see the first part of the flag. Let's save it somewhere and look at mycss.css and myjs.js files.

At the end of the mycss.css file, we get second part of our flag. Nice! Now, let's look at myjs.js file. 

The given hint probably directs us to robots.txt file. Let's go to this URL: http://mercury.picoctf.net:27278/robots.txt Wow, we get the third part.

Again, we are given a hit and according to that we should look at .htaccess file. Go to this URL: http://mercury.picoctf.net:27278/.htaccess The fourth part!!!

So, this hint may not seem obvious but a little research on "how does Mac store information" will query a Wikipedia page about [.DS_Store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.DS_Store) Therefore, let's try to go this URL: http://mercury.picoctf.net:27278/.DS_Store Yey! We get the fifth part.

Concatenate all the parts to get the flag.
